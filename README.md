# surfs_up


Overview

The overall purpose of this analysis was to analyze temperature trends in Oahu, with the intention of seeing whether a surf shop around the location can be viably run over the course of the year alongside an ice cream shop. More specifically, it emphasizes the use of SQLite to gather temperature data. We pulled from two particular months: June and December, as these are during the summer and winter seasons where expected customer arrival is at its supposed highest, and also gathered collective data on both months.

Results

The mean temperature in December is slightly lower in Oahu than in June, around 3 degrees lower
The standard deviation of temperatures in December is slightly higher than that of temperatures in June
Overall temperatures in December are around 10 degrees lower than in June
